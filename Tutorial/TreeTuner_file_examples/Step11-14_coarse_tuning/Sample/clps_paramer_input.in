### TreeTrimmer parameter input file

### The cutoff value for de-replication
# Specify a cutoff of support values (e.g. bootstrap values, posterior probability)
# either in integer (0-100) or decimal (0.0-1.0).
# Leave it blank or use default (0.0) for trees with no branch supports.

cutoff=0.0

### Query tag (optional: default is "query_tag=QUERY")
# If a tree includes a 'query' OTU, which is used as a reference 
# and is supposed to be retained after the de-replication process, 
# a string in the OTU name can be specified as a tag to avoid removal 

query_tag=564937

### Delimiter for categories of the taxonomic information
# (default: "taxon_delimiter=;\s" [semicolon plus single space])
# Only use regular expression for a space character

taxon_delimiter=;\s 

### Which taxonomic categories should be pruned? How many OTUs should be retained?
# The category information can be provided in Taxonomic_information_file,
# otherwise OTU names are used as labels of taxonomic information.
# example: Bacteria	2 (tab-delimited)

Bacteria	4
Archaea	3
Eukaryota	1

### How many OTUs should be retained in each supported branch of the tree unless specified above?

num_retained=1
